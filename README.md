# corporaRscripts

The aim of these scripts is to include some procedures I recently use to generate speech corpora:

1. Validate_ELAN_Files. This script it was designed to make it a little easier to edit and transform files coming from ELAN software. Some times it is very tricky to validate XML tags that could be included into annotation view from ELAN. So, if you use any kind of tagging format on your files, you can use this simply script to take all ELAN files from a folder, change the escaped tags to a non escaped format, add a new DTD (added also on this folder, but you can customize it on your own tags), edit the files with an XML editor (as Oxygen, for example), and replace non escaped tags with escaped ones; this way ELAN software will recognise this tags without stripping them. It is a way to validate ELAN files without extracting data, validating data and reuploading to new data files. It will allow you to edit the XML file directly generated by ELAN.
